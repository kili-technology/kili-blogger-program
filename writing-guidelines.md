## Writing steps checklist

When you write an article or a tutorial, make sure to follow the steps below :

- [ ] I download the [article template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fbD3m1kF74Bq4YK7hrlVKcSB_Wmll4eqcPqEsO3t6vc/edit#heading=h.28asgmypcla6) (It contains information to fill in when submitting your article.)
- [ ] I write the content of my article

- [ ] I Proofread my content for errors in grammar, spelling, and typography. (See Proofreading section below)
- [ ] I create the 2 images of my article. (See the Image section below)
- [ ] When my article is written, I fill in the submitting information on the top of the template
- [ ] I change the access rights to my Google Doc content so everyone with the link can modify it
- [ ] My article is ready for review: I comment on the Github Issue of my content with the share link and I add the label “To Review” to the Issue.

## Blog post spirit

While writing your article or tutorial, make sure that you follow the following spirit:

- Content should be state-of-the-art
- Content should be comprehensive by anyone
- Content target professionals and should be illustrated by business examples
- Tutorials should be easily reproducible: with clear code and steps well defined. If you get rif of the text and only keep code, it should allow to reproduce your code end-to-end (like a jupyter notebook). They should use Kili technology whenever it is possible.

## Structure

Make sure to follow the following structure for your article or for your tutorial :

### Structure for tutorials

## Proofreading:

## Images

Use this [Images template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1mahVWFp2weMSgtxS-qqKsOG7VKVSJXiqdImHGxKc__g/edit#slide=id.g103b3183b6a_0_14). There are 2 images to generate.

1. One for social media communication with your name and author picture (on slide 2)
2. One for the article thumbnail on the blog with a picture linked to your article (on slide 3)

### Steps to do :

  - Choose the right tag between “Article” and “Tutorial”. Do not change the font size
  - Change the title, make sure it is SEO friendly. Select a font size between 25 and 40
- On the social media image:
  - Change your name.
